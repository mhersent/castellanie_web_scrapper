Webscrapper in python for http://www.castellanie.net/

This webscrapper retrieves pictures from every scroll at this page: http://www.castellanie.net/acces.php

There is more pictures on the website than retrieved with this webscrapper:
Ex. for account B6740, 12 pictures retrieved for 19 total here http://www.castellanie.net/cote.php?cote=B6740 (counting 2 slides presenting the pictures)

**TODO**:
- **optionnal** transform todo list in issues
- get archive reference for pictures
- get citations block
- Get text
- get text in XML format (might not be possible since, for what I saw, it has been transformed in HTML)
- retrieve all images with other method
