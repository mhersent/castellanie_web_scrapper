Pictures downloaded from castellanie.net with python web scrapper (available here: https://github.com/mhersent/castellanie_web_scrapper)

Xml files unavailable at the time, since they aren't online (xml files used on the website to create html pages with xlst)
I will contact the CIHAM laboratory to ask if they can give them to me.
